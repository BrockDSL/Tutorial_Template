# Title of Tutorial
Description of tutorial including what you will learn and any tools that will be used in the process

----

## Setup Instructions
In preparation for this tutorial, you will need...

Include:
 - All software that needs to be downloaded
 - Any accounts that will need to be made including links to the sign up pages for those accounts
 - All files that will need to be downloaded in order to participate in the workshop as well as instructions on exactly how to download them.  

For all of the above, keep in mind that some people could be using machines on campus (or elsewhere) that might have limitations in regards to downloading tools and files so be sure to mention that somewhere.

## Tutorial Steps
Each tutorial will be different based on the tools used.  Breaking the tutorial up into individual steps is highly reccomended as it reduces congnitive load and allows for "break points" where users can stop and start from at their leisure.  Each step should cover no more than 1 or two concepts and should always assume that the user has minimal experience (explain every action in as granular detail as possible).

If you are enhancing your tutorial with embedded content like H5P modules or Youtube videos, make sure to check how they will look on different mediums.  Generally they will look good on any computer monitor or projector but depending on where you got the embed code from it may not adjust nicely for mobile and tablet viewing.

When embedding an iframe, make sure to place at least 2 blank lines above and below it in the markdown file to avoid the HTML interfereing with your markdown syntax.

## Next Steps (Optional)
This is where you can add any additional resources, follow up tutorial, or workshop reccomendations that users might use to continue learning about the tool described in the tutorial.  The more the better!
